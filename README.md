# Quasi-Random Search for Hyperparameter Optimisation

## Project Summary

In this project, I develop a hyperparameter optimisation program based on the Random Search method by Bergstra and Bengio from their 2012 paper 'Random search for hyper-parameter optimization', using quasirandom (low-discrepancy) number sequences instead of pseudorandom sequences. The program is demonstrated by optimising neural network (Tensorflow) hyperparameters for the Fashion-MNIST dataset.

This project was completed as part of an MSc in Data Science at Goldsmiths, University of London.
